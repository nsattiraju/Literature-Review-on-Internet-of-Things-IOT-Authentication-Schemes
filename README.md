# Literature-Review-on-Internet-of-Things-IOT-Authentication-Schemes
The emergence of Internet of Things (IOT) gives rise to unparalleled convenience, but at the same time, IOT devices and networks suffer from much more vulnerabilities compared with traditional networks. The nature of IOT (scalability, distributed system, cost/energy constraints) makes ensuring its security extremely challenging, and the consequences resulted from security compromise of IOT networks will be even severe. IOT architecture stack usually contains three layers: perception layer (physical layer and MAC layer), network layer, application layer. CIAAAA (confidentiality, integrity, availability, anonymity, authenticity) are key principles in cybersecurity. In this study, we explored and analyzed authentication protocols for IOT systems.
